    <h3>Program Note</h3>
    <p>
        This three-movement tone poem is about the day April 5th, when the sun reaches the celestial longitude of 15°. This day is the Qingming Festival (清明节, literally “Pure Brightness Festival”) among the Chinese-speaking population. There are many unique customs of this festival, which include hanging out in meadows of the countryside, flying kites, and sweeping the tombs of passed relatives.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first movement is about flying kites. The program is loosely based on a section from the 70th chapter of the novel Dream of the Red Chambers (红楼梦, or 石头记, The Tale of the Stone). Throughout this novel, the kite symbolizes the fate of one character who is far from home and unable to return. One poem that the character writes that functions as a foreshadowing:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        阶下儿童仰面时，清明装点最堪宜。<br>
        游丝一断浑无力，莫向东风怨别离。<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise,<br>
The term of “pure brightness” (qingming) is the meetest time this thing to make.<br>
The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays,<br>
The East wind don’t begrudge because its farewell it did take.<br>
(translated by H. Bencraft Joly)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The program of the first movement only follows the plot loosely. It begins with a depiction of the spring landscape in the fields. Later, some kids enter and start to fly kites. The kites end up entangling with each other, and the strings break. The kites fly away, and the kids all leave. The piece ends with a depiction of the kites flying to the point of infinity. This movement contains many smaller sections, each narrating part of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second movement is about a funeral. Apart from the cultural practice of this festival, this movement is inspired by Lao She’s 1933 short story “Vision” (微神). This story is about the narrator’s first love and how his lover ends up committing suicide because of lots of social issues. The main plot is in the middle, with a lengthy introduction describing the spring landscape and an epilogue describing a funeral in that landscape. This structural plan gives the story a dream-like feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        This movement is inspired by the epilogue of this story. It begins softly, with a simple melody floating on sustained chords. The middle section has more motion, building up to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>The third movement is about the April 5th Tiananmen Incident in 1976 (do not confuse with the incident in 1989). This incident begins with people mourning the death of Premier Zhou Enlai before the Qingming Festival at Tiananmen. People gathered and protested against the “Gang of the Four.” On April 5th, the authority sent troops and police to clear the protester by force. The military used wooden sticks and leather belts to expel protesters. There were no casualties, but 38 people were arrested.</p>
    <p>During the protest, people recited several poems. The most famous one is:</p>
    <blockquote>
        欲悲闻鬼叫，我哭豺狼笑。<br>洒泪祭雄杰，扬眉剑出鞘。<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In my grief I hear demons shriek; <br>
        I weep while wolves and jackals laugh. <br>
        Though tears I shed to mourn a hero, <br>
        With head raised high, I draw my sword.<br>
        (translated by Xiao Lan)<br>
        </blockquote>
    <p>There is also a famous couplet:</p>
    <blockquote>若有妖魔兴风浪，人民奋起灭豺狼。</blockquote>
    <blockquote>If there are devils who try to stir up disorder,<br>
        The people will stand up and demolish the evil wolves.<br>
        Translated by Jihang Dai<br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In this movement, there is a choral section that has four five-note phrases. That is to represent the five-syllabus poem. That is succeeded by two seven-note phrases that represent the couplet.</p>
        <p>Despite the chaotic nature of this movement, it ends peacefully with the material that opens the entire piece.</p>
